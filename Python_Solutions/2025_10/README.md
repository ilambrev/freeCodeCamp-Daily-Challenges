# 2025.10.01 Challenge - Binary To Decimal

My solution -> *[2025_10_01_binary_to_decimal](2025_10_01_binary_to_decimal.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Given a string representing a binary number, return its decimal equivalent as a number.

A binary number uses only the digits `0` and `1` to represent any number. To convert binary to decimal, multiply each digit by a power of `2` and add them together. Start by multiplying the rightmost digit by `2^0`, the next digit to the left by `2^1`, and so on. Once all digits have been multiplied by a power of `2`, add the result together.

For example, the binary number `101` equals `5` in decimal because:

```
1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
```

### **_Examples_**

```
Input: to_decimal("101") => Output: 5

Input: to_decimal("1010") => Output: 10

Input: to_decimal("10010") => Output: 18

Input: to_decimal("1010101") => Output: 85
```

# 2025.10.02 Challenge - Decimal To Binary

My solution -> *[2025_10_02_decimal_to_binary](2025_10_02_decimal_to_binary.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Given a non-negative integer, return its binary representation as a string.

A binary number uses only the digits `0` and `1` to represent any number. To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by `2` and record the remainder. Repeat until the number is zero. Read the remainders last recorded to first. For example, to convert `12` to binary:

```
12 รท 2 = 6 remainder 0
6 รท 2 = 3 remainder 0
3 รท 2 = 1 remainder 1
1 รท 2 = 0 remainder 1
```

`12` in binary is `1100`.

### **_Examples_**

```
Input: to_binary(5) => Output: "101"

Input: to_binary(12) => Output: "1100"

Input: to_binary(50) => Output: "110010"

Input: to_binary(99) => Output: "1100011"

# 2025.10.05 Challenge - Space Week Day 2: Exoplanet Search

My solution -> *[2025_10_05_space_week_day_2_exoplanet_search](2025_10_05_space_week_day_2_exoplanet_search.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

For the second day of Space Week, you are given a string where each character represents the luminosity reading of a star. Determine if the readings have detected an exoplanet using the transit method. The transit method is when a planet passes in front of a star, reducing its observed luminosity.

- Luminosity readings only comprise of characters `0-9` and `A-Z` where each reading corresponds to the following numerical values:
- Characters `0-9` correspond to luminosity levels `0-9`.
- Characters `A-Z` correspond to luminosity levels `10-35`.

A star is considered to have an exoplanet if any single reading is less than or equal to `80%` of the average of all readings. For example, if the average luminosity of a star is `10`, it would be considered to have a exoplanet if any single reading is `8` or less.

### **_Examples_**

```
Input: has_exoplanet("665544554") => Output: False

Input: has_exoplanet("FGFFCFFGG") => Output: True

# 2025.10.09 Challenge - Space Week Day 6: Moon Phase

My solution -> *[2025_10_09_space_week_day_6_moon_phase](2025_10_09_space_week_day_6_moon_phase.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

For day six of Space Week, you will be given a date in the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"` and need to determine the phase of the moon for that day using the following rules:

Use a simplified lunar cycle of `28` days, divided into four equal phases:

- `"New"`: days 1 - 7
- `"Waxing"`: days 8 - 14
- `"Full"`: days 15 - 21
- `"Waning"`: days 22 - 28

After day `28`, the cycle repeats with day `1`, a new moon.

### **_Examples_**

```
Input: moon_phase("2000-01-12") => Output: "New"

Input: moon_phase("2000-01-13") => Output: "Waxing"

Input: moon_phase("2014-10-15") => Output: "Full"

Input: moon_phase("2012-10-21") => Output: "Waning"

Input: moon_phase("2022-12-14") => Output: "New"
```

**_NOTES:_**

- Use `"2000-01-06"` as a reference new moon (day `1` of the cycle) to determine the phase of the given day.
- You will not be given any dates before the reference date.

# 2025.10.10 Challenge - Space Week Day 7: Launch Fuel

My solution -> *[2025_10_10_space_week_day_7_launch_fuel](2025_10_10_space_week_day_7_launch_fuel.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

For the final day of Space Week, you will be given the mass in kilograms (`kg`) of a payload you want to send to orbit. Determine the amount of fuel needed to send your payload to orbit using the following rules:

- Rockets require `1` kg of fuel per `5` kg of mass they must lift.
- Fuel itself has mass. So when you add fuel, the mass to lift goes up, which requires more fuel, which increases the mass, and so on.
- To calculate the total fuel needed: start with the payload mass, calculate the fuel needed for that, add that fuel to the total mass, and calculate again. Repeat this process until the additional fuel required is less than `1` kg, then stop.
- Ignore the mass of the rocket itself. Only compute fuel needed to lift the payload and its own fuel.

For example, given a payload mass of `50` kg, you would need `10` kg of fuel to lift it (`payload / 5`), which increases the total mass to `60` kg, which needs `12` kg to lift (`2` additional kg), which increases the total mass to `62` kg, which needs `12.4` kg to lift - `0.4` additional kg - which is less `1` additional kg, so we stop here. The total mass to lift is `62.4` kg, `50` of which is the initial payload and `12.4` of fuel.

- Return the amount of fuel needed rounded to one decimal place.

### **_Examples_**

```
Input: launch_fuel(50) => Output: 12.4

Input: launch_fuel(500) => Output: 124.8

Input: launch_fuel(243) => Output: 60.7

Input: launch_fuel(11000) => Output: 2749.8

# 2025.10.20 Challenge - Tip Calculator

My solution -> *[2025_10_20_tip_calculator](2025_10_20_tip_calculator.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Given the price of your meal and a custom tip percent, return an array with three tip values; `15%`, `20%`, and the custom amount.

- Prices will be given in the format: `"$N.NN"`.
- Custom tip percents will be given in this format: `"25%"`.
- Return amounts in the same `"$N.NN"` format, rounded to two decimal places.

For example, given a `"$10.00"` meal price, and a `"25%"` custom tip value, return `["$1.50", "$2.00", "$2.50"]`.

### **_Examples_**

```
Input: calculate_tips("$10.00", "25%") => Output: ["$1.50", "$2.00", "$2.50"]

Input: calculate_tips("$89.67", "26%") => Output: ["$13.45", "$17.93", "$23.31"]

Input: calculate_tips("$19.85", "9%") => Output: ["$2.98", "$3.97", "$1.79"]

# 2025.10.21 Challenge - Thermostat Adjuster 2

My solution -> *[2025_10_21_thermostat_adjuster_2](2025_10_21_thermostat_adjuster_2.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Given the current temperature of a room in `Fahrenheit` and a target temperature in `Celsius`, return a string indicating how to adjust the room temperature based on these constraints:

- Return `"Heat: X degrees Fahrenheit"` if the current temperature is below the target. With `X` being the number of degrees in `Fahrenheit` to heat the room to reach the target, rounded to `1` decimal place.
- Return `"Cool: X degrees Fahrenheit"` if the current temperature is above the target. With `X` being the number of degrees in `Fahrenheit` to cool the room to reach the target, rounded to `1` decimal place.
- Return `"Hold"` if the current temperature is equal to the target.

To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply the Celsius temperature by `1.8` and add `32` to the result (`F = (C * 1.8) + 32`).

### **_Examples_**

```
Input: adjust_thermostat(32, 0) => Output: "Hold"

Input: adjust_thermostat(70, 25) => Output: "Heat: 7.0 degrees Fahrenheit"

Input: adjust_thermostat(72, 18) => Output: "Cool: 7.6 degrees Fahrenheit"

Input: adjust_thermostat(212, 100) => Output: "Hold"

Input: adjust_thermostat(59, 22) => Output: "Heat: 12.6 degrees Fahrenheit"

# 2025.10.24 Challenge - Hidden Treasure

My solution -> *[2025_10_24_hidden_treasure](2025_10_24_hidden_treasure.py)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Given a 2D array representing a map of the ocean floor that includes a hidden treasure, and an array with the coordinates (`[row, column]`) for the next dive of your treasure search, return `"Empty"`, `"Found"`, or `"Recovered"` using the following rules:

- The given 2D array will contain exactly one unrecovered treasure, which will occupy multiple cells.
- Each cell in the 2D array will contain one of the following values:
  
  - `"-"`: No treasure.
  - `"O"`: A part of the treasure that has not been found.
  - `"X"`: A part of the treasure that has already been found.

- If the dive location has no treasure, return `"Empty"`.
- If the dive location finds treasure, but at least one other part of the treasure remains unfound, return `"Found"`.
- If the dive location finds the last unfound part of the treasure, return `"Recovered"`.

For example, given:

```
[
  [ "-", "X"],
  [ "-", "X"],
  [ "-", "O"]
]
```

And `[2, 1]` for the coordinates of the dive location, return `"Recovered"` because the dive found the last unfound part of the treasure.

### **_Examples_**

```
Input: dive([[ "-", "X"], [ "-", "X"], [ "-", "O"]], [2, 1]) => Output: "Recovered"

Input: dive([[ "-", "X"], [ "-", "X"], [ "-", "O"]], [2, 0]) => Output: "Empty"
